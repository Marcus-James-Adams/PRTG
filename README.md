# PRTG Centos Scripts
## Files and scripts used by PRTG services

* The scripts have been created on a centos distro but are easily modified for others
* I use a user account called prtg_monitor to run these scripts that is a member of appropriate groups eg docker.
* Scripts are designed to be fairly generic and will often be deisgned to have parameters passed to them.
